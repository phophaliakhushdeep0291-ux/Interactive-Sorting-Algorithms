# Interactive Sorting Algorithms in C++

An **interactive C++ project** demonstrating **classic sorting algorithms** with step-by-step visualization. This project showcases **DSA skills**, algorithm understanding, and C++ programming proficiency.

---

## Features

- Generate an array of custom size with random integers (0–99).  
- Choose from **five sorting algorithms**:  
  1. Bubble Sort  
  2. Insertion Sort  
  3. Selection Sort  
  4. Merge Sort  
  5. Quick Sort  
- Step-by-step visualization of array changes during sorting (for Bubble, Insertion, and Selection Sort).  
- Displays **original array** and **final sorted array**.  
- Written in **C++17**, using modern C++ features and modular design.
